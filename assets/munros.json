As a result, most climbers find themselves having to summit C\u00e0rn Eige not once, but twice, in order to reach and return from Beinn Fhionnlaidh. This double ascent adds an extra layer of complexity and effort, making the journey to this peak both demanding and rewarding for those who undertake it.",
